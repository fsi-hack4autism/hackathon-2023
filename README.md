# 2023 Financial Services Autism Hackathon
The main repo for the 2023 hackathon with all the information for the hackathon and pointers to all repositories. Hackathon informaton pertaining to 2023 specifically will remain in here. The individual repositories are made to span multiple years. This years hackathon will focus on ensuring the proper foundation for growth is establed for each use case. This means the repositories created this year will be use again in subsequent years provided these use cases are repeated again. We need to ensure these solutions will lead to real world outcomes.

## Dates and Location
The event will be hybrid. The in-person venue will be in NYC. We are currently evaluating two options for dates: 
- March 30 & 31
- April 6 & 7

## Use Cases
The following are the use cases for 2023. Each use case will have it's own repository with more specifics including the architecture.

### Use Case 1: IOT Data Collection
Dynamic programs require adaptations to data collection which are not supported by these systems. In the end teams frequently resort back to pen, paper, and mechanical devices such as hand tally counters. Can we take a different approach to this problem using an IoT pattern? Can we find a way to simplify data collection using simple mechanisms and use the cloud to store the data and classify it after the fact using modern tools and technologies? Can there be a repository of patterns to match the individual needs of learners and care providers?

### Use Case 2: Transform Learner Analysis with Video and AI
Data collection is essential to successful outcomes for learners, but analysts are missing one of the most critical pieces of data when they are reviewing progress and creating programs, video of the learner. Social Media knows how important and compelling this information is but it is not being used to help people with Autism more effectively. This use case looks to develop a platform to capture this information, integrate it with data from other sources, and enrich the analysis with AI. This is an ambitious use case to transform the industry using a vital form of information which is currently missing.


### Use Case 3: Using ML To Transform Learner Outcomes
There is a long-held belief that each individual case of autism is so unique that comparisons cannot be drawn to other cases, but marketing companies are able to use data to target the right message to us at the right time to sell their product. The therapies used to help learners with autism are data intensive. Can we use this data to transform outcomes for learners using modern technology and methods?



### Use Case 4: HoloLens Skills Training
This use case will focus on the use of HaloLens for helping to teach job skills to people with autism, particularly those aging out of the supports provided in the school environment. Unemployment for those with autism is significant and the supports in the work environment are limited. The use case will use HaloLens augmented reality to help with basic job skills by presenting a visual cues on how to complete task such as stocking shelves or preparing food. This scenario should also address the issue of moving away from 1:1 support to a 1:n as an a student becomes an adult.



### Use Case 5: Metaverse Social Practice
Developing social relationships with peers can be one of the biggest challenges for people with autism, despite a strong desire to form them. Social programs can be hard to practice due to limited opportunities, which can lead to disappointing outcomes in the few interactions, and stress can and frustration. The Metaverse offers an opportunity to practice social interactions in a fully immersive environment and the ability to formulate successful programs which can repleted at scale. This use case will lay the groundwork for a social interaction in the Metaverse between a subject and an AI generated peer.
